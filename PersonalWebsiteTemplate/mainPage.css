/*
A coule of tips I learned along the way:
    - Research Keyframe Animations
    - Look at this example of animating things
      using classes. Makes things really easy.
      THOUGH I wouldn't focus on that til 90%
      of your website is finished.
        See Example:
      https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-animations-scroll/

    - If youre thinking of a feature, bootstrap probably
      has it implemented already
    - Use google chromes mobile phone feature in Inspect Element

body {

    /* You can change this but in my opinion it works better for mobile
        It does not let the user scroll on the X axis, only the Y axis.  */
    overflow-x: hidden
}
